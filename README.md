# PlaGeU
Plane Generation Stuff For Unity

# ?
This provides users the ability to quickly generate planes of any dimension and resolution.

# Why
I made this to solve a problem of water planes. Often, if I wanted a high res plane, I would have to open a 3d modeling tool, build the mesh, 
and then export the mesh to my unity project. This was tedious. So, I made a solution that would let me create a plane of any dimensions and resolution.

# How To Use
Download the project from the code green code button and drag the extracted folder into your unity assets folder. 
Then, just attach the PLGE_PlaneGenerator script to an empty object. Then, enter your planes dimensions and resolution and click build plane.
Last, Enjoy!

note: it will generate a mesh with no material, so it will show up as pink. To fix this, just drag a material of your choice onto the plane and it
will go away.
