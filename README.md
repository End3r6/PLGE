# PLaGeU
Plane Generation Stuff For Unity

# What
This provides users the ability to quickly generate planes of any dimension and resolution.

# Why
I made this to solve a problem of water planes. Often, if I wanted a high res plane, I would have to open a 3d modeling tool, build the mesh, 
and then export the mesh to my unity project. This was tedious. So, I made a solution that would let me create a plane of any dimensions and resolution with just a click of a button.

# How To Use

Download the most recent release and drag the extracted folder into your unity assets folder. 
Next, under Tools/Plague, choose which plane you wish to generate. Once you open your chosen window, enter the dimensions, resolution, the material and the number chunks for the plane you wish to generate. After you are done with that, press build plane.
Last, Enjoy!

note: Unless you specify a material, the mesh will show up as pink just specify a material and it will all work out :)
